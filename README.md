# Adapt Programming Language Interpreter
This repository hosts the interpreter for the Adapt Programming Language. There will be a compiler version developed later on, but currently, an interpreter is used.

## What is Adapt?
Adapt is a new programming language which lets *you* change how it works! You can modify primitive types, choose different paradigms, and even extend the functionality of the language yourself!

Adapt gives you control of your programming language through a few lines of code that you put at the top of your files or in a header file that you include as a module.
